## INTRODUCTION TO SMART SWIMMING POOL

Swimming pools are a popular source of recreation, but ensuring the safety of 
swimmers and maintaining optimal water quality are crucial concerns. This 
project introduces the IoT-based Smart Swimming Pool Monitoring System, 
designed to enhance safety and water quality management. 
Situated in Rwanda, this system leverages state-of-the-art technology to provide a 
safer and more enjoyable swimming experience.

The primary objective is to improve swimming pool safety, water quality, and 
operational efficiency by integrating IoT technology. This system features a 
wearable monitoring device equipped with pH,  temperature, and heartbeat sensors that continuously collect real-time data, 
monitoring both water conditions and swimmers' well-being.

At its core, the system relies on IoT connectivity. An ESP8266 module, integrated 
into the wearable device, facilitates real-time data collection and secure 
underwater Wi-Fi communication for transmitting data to a cloud-based platform. 
This cloud platform, integrated with the Arduino IoT Cloud, serves as the hub for 
data storage, analysis, and visualization.

Users, including pool operators and authorities, access the cloud platform 
through web interfaces and mobile apps. Real-time data visualization, historical 
analysis, and customizable alerts empower users to make informed decisions. 
Alerts can be configured to trigger when predefined thresholds for pH, 
temperature, or irregular heartbeats are exceeded, enabling proactive 
interventions

 ## Objectives
 
 1. Water Quality Monitoring:
Develop a robust IoT-based system capable of continuous and real-time monitoring and maintenance of swimming pool water quality, 
ensuring it consistently meets established safety and hygiene standards.
2. Swimmer Safety:
Implement an integrated real-time heartbeat monitoring system using wearable devices or underwater sensors to promptly detect irregularities in swimmers' heart rates and enhance their safety while swimming.
3. Data Analytics and Reporting:
Employ advanced data analytics algorithms to process the collected data, generating insights, trends, and real-time reporting for pool operators and relevant authorities, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## CIRCUITLY SYSTEM WORKING PRINCIPLE ðŸ’¼

In the Smart Swimming Pool Monitoring System, each swimmer wears a 
specialized wearable device equipped with integrated sensors designed for 
comprehensive monitoring. These sensors 
include a pH water sensor, responsible for continuously measuring and 
monitoring the pH level of the pool water, ensuring optimal water quality. 
Additionally, a water temperature sensor is incorporated, providing real-time 
temperature data of the pool water for comfort and safety 
assessment. Furthermore, the wearable device features a heartbeat sensor, 
constantly monitoring the swimmer's heart rate to ensure their well-being during 
aquatic activities. The integrated ESP8266 module within the wearable device 
facilitates Wi-Fi communication, including underwater data transmission to the 
cloud. This collected data, which includes pH levels, water temperature, and 
swimmers' heart rates, is organized and processed within the wearable device, 
securely transmitted to the cloud platform, and integrated with the Arduino IoT 
Cloud. This platform empowers users, such as pool operators and authorities, to 
access real-time data visualization and historical analysis, enabling data-driven 
decisions. The system can also be configured to issue alerts and notifications 
when predefined thresholds are exceeded, thereby enhancing swimmer safety.
