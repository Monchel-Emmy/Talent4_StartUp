# 1 introduction to smart swimming pool

Swimming pools are a popular source of recreation, but ensuring the safety of
swimmers and maintaining optimal water quality are crucial concerns. This
project introduces the IoT-based Smart Swimming Pool Monitoring System,
designed to enhance safety and water quality management.

Situated in Rwanda, this system leverages state-of-the-art technology to provide a
safer and more enjoyable swimming experience.
The primary objective is to improve swimming pool safety, water quality, and
operational efficiency by integrating IoT technology. This system features a
wearable monitoring device equipped with pH,
temperature, and heartbeat sensors that continuously collect real-time data,
monitoring both water conditions and swimmers' well-being.

At its core, the system relies on IoT connectivity. An ESP8266 module, integrated
into the wearable device, facilitates real-time data collection and secure
underwater Wi-Fi communication for transmitting data to a cloud-based platform.
This cloud platform, integrated with the Arduino IoT Cloud, serves as the hub for
data storage, analysis, and visualization.

Users, including pool operators and authorities, access the cloud platform
through web interfaces and mobile apps. Real-time data visualization, historical
analysis, and customizable alerts empower users to make informed decisions.
Alerts can be configured to trigger when predefined thresholds for pH,
temperature, or irregular heartbeats are exceeded, enabling proactive
interventions
